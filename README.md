🚀 About The Project

This project is an exploration into the fundamentals of shell programming. The goal is to recreate a command-line interface environment that behaves similarly to Bash, handling command execution, input/output, and potentially more advanced shell features. The use of the Readline library enhances the user experience by providing features like command history, line editing, and auto-completion.
✨ Features

    Interactive Prompt: A custom command prompt for user input.

    Command Execution: Ability to parse and execute external commands.

    Readline Integration: Utilizes GNU Readline for:

        Command history (up/down arrow navigation)

        Line editing (insert, delete, navigate characters)

        Basic auto-completion

🛠️ Technologies Used

    C Language: The core language for the shell implementation.

    GNU Readline Library: For handling interactive command-line input.
